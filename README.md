# Website Project

## Overview
This project is a multi-page website featuring a nested menu structure. The homepage displays three web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), each of which reveals four related topics when clicked. Each topic has its own dedicated page, allowing users to explore content in detail. A "Back" button is provided on each topic page to return to the homepage.

## Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **index.html**: The homepage that displays the technologies and manages the show/hide functionality for topics.
- **css/style.css**: Contains the main styles for the homepage, including layout, fonts, colors, and responsive design elements.
- **css/topic.css**: Styles specific to the topic pages, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
- **js/script.js**: Handles the show/hide functionality for the nested menu structure and navigation behavior.
- **topics/**: Contains subdirectories for each technology, with each subdirectory containing topic pages.
